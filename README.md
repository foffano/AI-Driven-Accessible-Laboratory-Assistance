# AI-Driven Accessible Laboratory Assistance

This project is divided into two parts, each contained within its own directory.

## Part I: Evaluation of the Multimodal LLM Using a Controlled Image Dataset

This part contains the code and data for evaluating the multimodal LLM against a controlled set of images.

- `part_one/adc.py`: The main script for the evaluation.
- `part_one/dataset/`: The controlled image dataset.

## Part II: Real-World Evaluation of the Integrated Assistive System

This part will contain the code and resources for the real-world evaluation of the integrated assistive system. This section is currently under development.
